/* First I created the table and inserted the data from a dataset on Kaggle */

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

/*Then, I played around with the data and explored it*/

/*The first exploration I made included finding the 10 most popular tracks and what artist made them*/

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

/*Then I looked at the average popularity, danceability, and duration of tracks.

SELECT avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata

/*Then, I looked at which songs had both popularity above 80 and a duration of over 165000 ms to see if there was a clear correlation between the two*/

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 80 AND duration_ms > 165000
ORDER BY duration_ms

/*These results did not immediately show any clear correlation*/
